# Project state

Updated when a task completes. `bash scripts/check.sh` is the ground truth;
this file is a convenience index, not an authority.

## Current phase

Sub-project 1: network core. **In progress — Tasks 1-15 landed. Relay deployed and verified at the 500-player target; only the two-PC acceptance test (16) remains, plus the stub coordinator and service entrypoint it needs.**

## Blockers

| Blocker | Detail | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Go not installed~~ | Resolved 2026-08-18. Go 1.26.6 extracted to `C:\Users\Mcc\sdk\go` (no admin rights needed), fetched from the Aliyun mirror and verified against go.dev's own SHA-256. `scripts/env.sh` puts it on PATH for every script. See decisions D11. | resolved |
| ~~`make` not installed~~ | Replaced by `scripts/build.sh`. See decisions D12. | resolved |
| Uplink port speed unknown | MobinHost has not confirmed the server's port speed. Deferred by the owner until the product works. | product owner |
| ~~No second machine for load generation~~ | Resolved differently: the owner set the target to 500 concurrent players (2026-08-18), which is verifiable on this box. Measured 0.000% loss, 2.8 ms median, 1.6 of 4 cores used. No second VPS needed. | resolved |
| Data plane not using batched syscalls | One `sendto`/`recvfrom` per packet caps the relay near 30k pps, which covers the 500-player target with headroom but not much beyond it. `recvmmsg`/`sendmmsg` batching is the standard fix. Deferred: not needed at the current target. | deferred |
| Race detector unavailable locally | `go test -race` needs cgo and there is no C compiler on the dev PC. Run it on the Linux server, which has one. Not yet scripted. | open |
| ~~Relay not deployable~~ | Resolved 2026-08-18. `scripts/deploy.sh` builds, uploads and restarts it under systemd. Live on UDP 443 at 87.107.110.199, verified reachable from the dev PC at 4-8 ms. | resolved |

## Open questions

1. **Can a new player take over an abandoned slot in a running Dota LAN match?**
   Reconnecting your own dropped player works; a different person filling the
   slot is unverified. The dynamic room flow depends on it. Answered by Task 16.
2. Real per-player bandwidth — estimated, not measured. Task 15/16.
3. Wintun redistribution licence — the DLL is embedded in the binary
   (`netservice/internal/adapter/bin/wintun.dll`, v0.14.1, Authenticode
   signature verified as WireGuard LLC). Confirm redistribution terms before
   shipping a public installer.
